Short answer up front: I can’t help find or provide **“free unlimited API keys”** — that would be asking for credentials or ways to bypass provider limits, which I must refuse. Sharing or using someone else’s API key, or trying to circumvent rate/usage limits, is unsafe and usually illegal.

That said — if your goal is *practical and cost-effective “unlimited-ish” capacity* for DocINX, there are legitimate approaches you can take right now (free tiers, fallbacks, and self-hosting) so you don’t depend on a single paid key. Below I’ll give a compact, actionable plan plus references so you can implement it safely.

---

# Why “unlimited free key” is not a thing

* Large LLM & embedding providers charge to cover compute costs; unlimited free access would be unsustainable and is not offered.
* Attempting to use leaked/unauthorized keys or workarounds is unethical and exposes you to legal, security, and billing risks.

---

# Practical alternatives (legal, safe, and scalable)

## 1) Use providers’ free tiers / trial keys (for prototyping)

Many reputable providers give limited free tiers or trial credits so you can prototype. These are fine for dev and small pilots, but **not unlimited**:

* Cohere offers trial/free developer access for prototypes. ([Cohere][1])
* Hugging Face provides hosted inference with pay-as-you-go and some free access for small usage — good for testing models. ([Hugging Face][2])
* Vector DBs like Pinecone and Weaviate offer starter/free tiers useful for prototypes (Pinecone starter has caps). ([Pinecone][3])

Use these for quick validation — track usage and add fallbacks so you don’t get blocked when you hit limits.

---

## 2) Self-host embeddings & models (best route toward “unlimited” control)

If you need high-volume or continuous use without per-request billing, self-hosting is the way to go. Key components:

* **Embeddings:** run Sentence-Transformers locally (open-source). This gives you high-quality embeddings with no per-call billing. ([SBERT][4])
* **Vector store:** use open-source pgvector in Postgres (or Milvus) to host vectors yourself. pgvector is free/open-source and integrates with Postgres. ([GitHub][5])
* **LLM inference:** host an open-source model (many models are available on Hugging Face) using a local inference stack (transformers, text-generation-inference, or dedicated inference servers). This requires hardware (GPU) for reasonable speed. ([Hugging Face][2])

Benefits: no per-request provider costs, full data control, and predictable scaling (you control infra costs). Downsides: you need infra (GPUs for big LLMs) and ops to maintain.

## 3) Hybrid approach (recommended for DocINX)

Mix managed APIs + local fallbacks:

* Primary: managed provider (OpenAI/Cohere/HF) for peak quality/complex tasks.
* Secondary fallback: local sentence-transformers for embeddings + smaller local LLM for routine queries.
* Vector DB: managed Pinecone/Weaviate for ease + local pgvector as fallback or for heavy batch workloads. This lets you avoid total outages and runaway bills. Pinecone/Weaviate starter tiers are good for testing. ([Pinecone][3])

# Quick how-to: low-cost “unlimited-ish” stack (practical steps)

1. **Start local dev**

   * Install Postgres + pgvector. Create a `documents` and `vectors` table. (pgvector docs). ([GitHub][5])

2. **Local embedding server (simple)**

   * Use SentenceTransformers to compute embeddings and expose a tiny REST API (Flask/FastAPI). This removes dependence on external embedding quotas. (See SentenceTransformers docs). ([SBERT][4])

3. **Vector search**

   * Store vectors in pgvector and use approximate nearest neighbor (ivfflat/hnsw) for speed. This is low-cost and scales horizontally with more DB resources. ([GitHub][5])

4. **LLM inference**

   * For high-quality answers use a managed provider when available; for cheaper/always-on use a locally hosted smaller model (or a Hugging Face hosted model with careful budgeting). ([Hugging Face][2])

5. **Operational safety**

   * Add per-workspace quotas, caching, and aggressive embedding dedupe (cache embeddings by chunk hash). Batch embeddings and reuse results to drastically lower calls.

# Concrete resources / docs to read (start here)

* SentenceTransformers — local embeddings & examples. ([SBERT][4])
* pgvector (open-source vector extension for Postgres). ([GitHub][5])
* Pinecone starter plan and limits (managed vector DB). ([Pinecone][3])
* Weaviate serverless and paid tiers (managed serverless vector DB). ([Weaviate][6])
* Hugging Face inference and model hosting documentation (many models available). ([Hugging Face][2])

# Short recommendation (what I’d do for DocINX MVP)

1. Prototype using a **free trial** of a managed embedding/LLM provider (Cohere/Hugging Face/OpenAI if you have credits) to validate UX. ([Cohere][1])
2. Put embedding generation behind a worker queue and cache embeddings by chunk hash. When trial credits run low, switch embedding jobs to a **local SentenceTransformers service**. ([SBERT][4])
3. Use **pgvector** in Postgres for your vector store during pilot (cheap & simple). Move to Pinecone/Weaviate later if you need managed scaling. ([GitHub][5])

# I can help with any of the following (pick one)

* Provide a 1–2 page setup guide: “How to run SentenceTransformers + pgvector for embeddings (Dockerized).”
* Generate the FastAPI embedding microservice code + Dockerfile (ready to run).
* Produce DB migration SQL for pgvector and an ingestion worker (Celery) example.

Which would you like me to generate now? (I’ll produce runnable code / infra steps — no keys involved.)
