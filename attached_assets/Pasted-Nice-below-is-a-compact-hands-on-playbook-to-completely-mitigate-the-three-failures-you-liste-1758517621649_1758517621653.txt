Nice — below is a compact, hands-on playbook to **completely mitigate** the three failures you listed and make DocINX resilient:
**OpenAI quota exceeded → embedding generation blocked**, **GPT-4 inaccessible**, and **vector search failing because of those API issues**. I include immediate actions you can take now, medium-term fixes, long-term architecture patterns, UI/UX handling, monitoring, and copy-pasteable code snippets.

---

# TL;DR (what to do now)

1. Put embedding jobs into a durable queue and mark documents **partially indexed**. Serve cached results / fallback search while reindexing.
2. Add exponential backoff + retry + circuit breaker for OpenAI calls. If embedding calls fail due to quota, switch to a fallback embedding model (local sentence-transformers) or alternate provider.
3. If GPT-4 is inaccessible, fallback to another LLM (Claude, Cohere, local LLaMA/Mistral) or to a template-based answer using retrieved snippets (no generation).
4. If vector search fails, fallback to a keyword/BM25 search (Postgres full-text) or TF-IDF similarity and show partial results with a notice.
5. Add alerts (high error rate / quota usage) and a dashboard for quota usage so you can act before hitting limits.

# Immediate fixes (deploy within hours)

**A. Stop hard failures — graceful degradation**

* On failed embedding generation mark the document status: `indexing_pending_quota` (or `partial`) and enqueue into retry queue (dead-letter after N tries).
* Serve the UI with: “Document uploaded and queued for indexing. Meanwhile you can search existing indexed docs.” Don’t block the uploader.

**B. Quick fallbacks for embeddings**

* Try a cheaper/alternate embedding endpoint (if available on your account).
* If quota error persists, call a local open-source embedding model (sentence-transformers) as fallback. This requires CPU/GPU but is immediate for small pilots.

**C. Quick fallbacks for LLM (GPT-4)**

* If GPT-4 returns `model_not_found` or similar, immediately fall back to:

  * GPT-4-turbo / GPT-4o / a smaller OpenAI model you have access to, OR
  * Another provider’s model (Anthropic Claude, Cohere) if you have API keys, OR
  * A (safe) deterministic mode: produce a response by concatenating top-k retrieved snippets with a short summary template (no LLM).

**D. Quick fallbacks for vector search failures**

* If your vector DB is functional but embeddings missing for some docs, only search the indexed subset and surface partial results.
* If vector DB itself responds with API/timeout errors, use Postgres full-text search / Elasticsearch / Whoosh / simple TF-IDF on stored raw text as fallback.

---

# Medium-term fixes (days → weeks)

**1. Implement robust retry + backoff + circuit breaker**

* Retries with jitter exponential backoff for transient errors. After N retries open circuit for T minutes to avoid hammering the API and burning quota.
* Example conditions to open circuit: repeated 429 (rate limit) or 5xx.

**2. Use a durable ingestion queue + workers**

* Use SQS / RabbitMQ / Kafka / Redis streams + workers. Workers pop jobs, try to embed, persist embedding, ack. On error, requeue with delay. Put permanently failing jobs into DLQ.

**3. Multi-provider & model-agnostic embedding + LLM layer**

* Implement an abstraction layer: `Embed(text) -> (vector, providerTag)` and `Generate(prompt) -> (text, providerTag)`.
* Provider switch logic: prefer primary; if failure or quota exceeded, route to secondary provider or local model.

**4. Caching & deduplication**

* Cache embeddings for identical text chunks. Deduplicate documents (hash) to avoid repeated embedding for same content.

**5. Batch & compress embedding requests**

* Batch multiple chunks into a single embedding API call where supported to reduce call count and cost. Also reduce dimension if acceptable.

**6. Offline reindexing and progressive rollouts**

* Reindex in background during off-peak hours. Use incremental updates and a versioned index so you can roll back.

# Long-term architecture (production-grade)

1. **Hybrid approach**: primary = managed API (OpenAI), fallback = on-prem/hosted open models (sentence-transformers, Ollama, transformer inference) + alternate cloud vendors.
2. **Cost & quota management**: rate limiting at client + token usage budget per workspace + monthly alerts + automated key rotation.
3. **Observability**: Track metrics — API latency, error rate, 429 counts, tokens consumed, embedding qps, queue depth. Add dashboards & alerts.
4. **Graceful UX**: always show provenance + whether result used fallback model. Provide a toggle: “Prefer cheaper/local fallback” in admin.
5. **Legal/Privacy**: If falling back to external providers, warn about data leaving your environment. Offer private model hosting for sensitive customers.

---

# Monitoring & Alerts (what to monitor)

* 429 / quota\_exceeded counts (per provider + per key).
* Token consumption per day / per workspace.
* Queue depth and retry rates.
* Percentage of requests served from fallback model.
* Vector DB health (latency, error rates).
  Trigger alerts at thresholds (e.g., 80% quota consumed).

---

# UI/UX guidance for transparency

* When using fallback show a small tag: “Answer produced with fallback model” + explain difference.
* For partially indexed docs show: “Indexing pending — search only indexed docs.”
* Provide an “indexing status” page for admins: queue depth, last success, failure reasons, retry count.

# Practical code examples

Below are minimal Python snippets illustrating robust embedding + LLM calls with fallback and retry. Adapt into your worker services.

## 1) Embedding generation with retry + fallback to local model

```python
import time
import random
from typing import List, Tuple

# PSEUDO: replace with your clients
from openai import OpenAIClientError  # placeholder
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

PRIMARY_EMBEDDER = "openai"
SECONDARY_EMBEDDER = "local_sentence_transformer"

local_model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")  # local fallback

def exponential_backoff_sleep(base=0.5, attempt=1, max_sleep=10.0):
    jitter = random.uniform(0, base)
    sleep = min(max_sleep, (2 ** (attempt-1)) * base + jitter)
    time.sleep(sleep)

def generate_embeddings(texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]:
    # Try primary provider first (OpenAI)
    max_retries = 5
    for attempt in range(1, max_retries+1):
        try:
            # Replace with your OpenAI embeddings call
            vectors = call_openai_embeddings_api(texts)  # may raise OpenAIClientError for 429/quota
            return vectors
        except OpenAIClientError as e:
            # if it's a quota error or rate limit, retry with backoff
            if is_quota_or_retryable(e):
                exponential_backoff_sleep(attempt=attempt)
                continue
            else:
                # non-retryable -> break and fallback
                break

    # Fallback: local embedding
    print("FALLBACK: using local sentence-transformer for embeddings")
    return [local_model.encode(t).tolist() for t in texts]
```

`is_quota_or_retryable(e)` should inspect error codes (429, rate\_limit, transient 5xx). `call_openai_embeddings_api` is your wrapper which also logs token consumption and provider metadata.

---

## 2) LLM generation with provider fallback & circuit breaker

```python
def generate_answer(prompt: str, retrieved_docs: List[str]) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    # Build prompt
    prompt_payload = build_prompt(prompt, retrieved_docs)

    # Try primary LLM (GPT-4)
    try:
        return call_openai_completion(prompt_payload, model="gpt-4"), "openai-gpt4"
    except OpenAIClientError as e:
        if is_quota_or_model_missing(e):
            # Try smaller model or alternate provider
            try:
                return call_openai_completion(prompt_payload, model="gpt-4o"), "openai-gpt4o"
            except Exception:
                pass
            try:
                return call_anthropic_completion(prompt_payload), "anthropic-claude"
            except Exception:
                pass

        # Last-resort deterministic reply: stitch retrieved docs + short summary
        stitch = "\n\n---\n".join(retrieved_docs[:3])
        fallback_answer = f"Top referenced snippets:\n\n{stitch}\n\n(Generated without LLM due to provider outage.)"
        return fallback_answer, "deterministic-stitch"
```

---

## 3) Vector search fallback to Postgres BM25

If vector DB errors (timeouts, unavailability), fallback to Postgres full-text:

```sql
-- sample table schema: documents(id, content, tsv)
-- tsv is a tsvector built from content
SELECT id, ts_rank(tsv, plainto_tsquery($1)) AS rank
FROM documents
WHERE tsv @@ plainto_tsquery($1)
ORDER BY rank DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Programmatic flow:

1. Try vector search; if error or no vectors, run PG full-text query.
2. Return results with a `sourceType` tag = 'bm25' or 'vector'.

---

# Repair & reindex strategies (for when you hit quota and missed a batch)

* Keep a durable record of which document chunks are missing embeddings (table `chunks` with `embed_status`).
* Background job `reindex_scheduler` wakes up and attempts to re-embed pending chunks with backoff.
* Optionally throttle reindexing and run at off-peak hours to avoid consuming quota during business hours.

---

# Preventive cost & quota best practices

* Set per-workspace monthly budgets and stop non-critical background jobs once 90% budget consumed.
* Use cheaper embedding models for high-volume indexing, and reserve expensive models for high-value queries.
* Aggregate small documents into mixed chunks to reduce embedding count.
* Cache embedding results by chunk hash and reuse.

---

# Quick checklist you can run now (copy into your sprint)

* [ ] Add `embed_status` & `doc_index_status` fields and mark partial/indexing\_pending states.
* [ ] Put embedding tasks into durable queue + add DLQ.
* [ ] Implement retry + exponential backoff (max 5 tries) and circuit breaker (open for 10–30 minutes after N failures).
* [ ] Add local sentence-transformer fallback for embeddings.
* [ ] Add alternate LLM provider or deterministic snippet stitching as fallback.
* [ ] Implement vector search fallback to Postgres/Elasticsearch.
* [ ] Add dashboards/alerts for 429/quota/requests per minute.
* [ ] Update UI messages to be transparent about fallbacks and indexing state.

# What I can do next (pick one)

* Draft the code for a resilient worker (Full Python Celery worker with retries, DLQ, and fallback).
* Create a minimal local embedding server (sentence-transformers + REST) for fallback usage.
* Produce the DB migration scripts and queue schema for `embed_status` & DLQ.

Which of these should I generate for you now?
